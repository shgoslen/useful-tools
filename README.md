# useful-tools
A collection of useful tools that I've created over the years
Some of these are log scraper using bash and awk
Some are statisitcal tools using the Student T's tests that I've used to understand large sets of data
Some are bash scripts to look for new software images to test and fire up a set of Automated tests
And anything else that I've found usefull to hang onto
